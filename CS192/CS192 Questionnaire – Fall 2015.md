# CS192 Questionnaire – Fall 2015

**Answer ALL questions. If question does not apply to you, write does not apply.**

1. Your name and hometown:
	* Connor Shea
	* Highlands Ranch, Colorado


2. What is your major? How much confidence do you have in your choice of major?
	* My major will be either:
		* ACT with Computing Technology concentration
		* ACT with Human-Centered Computing concentration
	* I am certain that I'd like to earn a degree in Computer Science, and would like to have a career as a User Interface Designer and Developer. My only problem is with the requirement of Calculus II by the Human-Centered Computing concentration, but not by the Computing Technology concentration.
	* I'm also concerned that the value of an "Applied Computing Technologies" degree would be less than that of a "Computer Science" degree, for no good reason. CU Boulder has their Human-Centered Computing concentration under Computer Science, so I'm interested in knowing why it's separated at CSU.


3. For what college math (if any) do you already have credit? What math courses are you taking this semester?
	* I’ve taken College Algebra and College Trig at ACC, the credits for which were transferred to CSU. I’m taking One Year Calculus this semester.


4. What computer science courses are you taking this semester?
	* This Computer Science Seminar and CS160 Foundations in Programming.


5. What have you done with computers in the past (as a hobby, job, classes, etc.)? With what specific computer languages and computer operating systems, if any, do you have any experience?
	* I built the following three projects with my friend Anthony Super, who is also in this class:
		* WavHead - WavHead lets people at your events vote on what music they want to hear. Voting happens from their mobile devices. It uses Sinatra (Ruby), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery).
		* ImageHex - ImageHex is a place to search, share, and commission images and other artwork. It uses the web framework Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript (with jQuery).
		* Fiction Dock - Fiction Dock is a central repository for people to write and share their fan fiction. It uses the same frameworks/languages as ImageHex, plus React.js.
	* A redesign of PCGamingWiki - From February to August of 2015, I spent quite a bit of time overhauling the site to be more navigable and faster. It uses MediaWiki and PHP, with LESS as a CSS pre-processor.
	* I designed and developed my personal website.
	* I've also done Freelance Web Design/Development for a little over six months.
	* I have experience with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript (with jQuery, mostly), Ruby on Rails, React.js, and PHP/MediaWiki.
	* I have significant experience with OS X, moderate experience with Ubuntu Linux, and moderate experience with Windows.

6. List any topics you hope we will cover in this course.
	* Revision Control (e.g. Git, GitHub)
