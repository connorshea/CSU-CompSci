1) Translate the given statement into propositional logic using the propositions provided: You can ride the Max bus system if you have a student card or if you have paid the fare. Express your answer in terms of p: "You can ride the Max bus system," q: "You have a student card", and s: "You have paid the fare."
q ∨ s → p


// Use truth tables to prove these equivalences, and state the name: 
2) a) p ∧ T is equivalent to p

p | T | p ∧ T
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

Simplification


b) p ∧ F is equivalent to F

p | F | p ∧ F
0 | 0 | 0
1 | 0 | 0

Simplification


c) p ∨ ¬p is equivalent to T

p | ¬p | p ∨ ¬p
1 | 0  | 1
0 | 1  | 1

Modus Tollens


d) p ∨ (p ∧ q) is equivalent to p

p | q | p ∧ q | p ∨ (p ∧ q)
0 | 0 | 0     | 0
0 | 1 | 0     | 0
1 | 0 | 0     | 1
1 | 1 | 1     | 1

Absorption Laws


3) Use De Morgan's law to find the negation of each of the following conditions in Java, and shown the resulting condition in Java: 

a) (index < 10 || index > 20)

Answer: (index >= 10 && index <= 20)

b) (p != false && q == false)

Answer: (p == false || q != false)


4) Show that the following conditional statement is a tautology by using truth tables. 

¬p → (p → q)

p | q | ¬p | p → q | ¬p → (p → q)
0 | 0 | 1  | 1     | 1
0 | 1 | 1  | 1     | 1
1 | 0 | 0  | 0     | 1
1 | 1 | 0  | 1     | 1


5) Define tautology, contradiction, and contingency. 
- A tautology is a proposition that will always be true.
- A contradiction is a compound proposition that will always be false.
- A contingency is neither true nor false.


6) Show the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of p → q.
- Converse: q → p
- Contrapositive: ¬q → ¬p
- Inverse: ¬p → ¬q


7) Prove the following logical equivalence using only the logical equivalences and laws on the Logic Sheet. 

p ∨ (¬p ∧ q) ≡ (p ∨ q)

Proof:
Step 1. p ∨ (¬p ∧ q), then apply Distributive Law
Step 2. (p ∨ ¬p) ∧ (p ∨ q), then apply Absorption Law
Step 3. T ∧ (p ∨ q)


8) Prove the logical equivalence above using a truth table.

p | q | ¬p ∧ q | p ∨ (¬p ∧ q) | p ∨ q | p ∨ (¬p ∧ q) ≡ (p ∨ q)
0 | 0 | 0      | 0            | 0     | 1
0 | 1 | 1      | 1            | 1     | 1
1 | 0 | 0      | 1            | 1     | 1
1 | 1 | 0      | 1            | 1     | 1
