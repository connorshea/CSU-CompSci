### Problems Involving Sets

Given that:

* N = {0,1,2,3,4,...} is the set of natural numbers
* Z = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...} is the set of all integers
* Z+ = {1,2,3,4,....} is the set of all positive integers
* R is the set of all real numbers


1. For each of these pairs of sets, determine whether the first is a subset of the second, the second a subset of the first, or neither is a subset of the other.

  a. The set of students in this class, and the set of students who are majoring in Computer Science in this class.

  The second is the subset of the first.

  
  b. the set of mammals, the set of land mammals.

  The second is the subset of the first.


  c. the set of students studying computer science, the set of students studying mathematics

  Neither is a subset of the other.



2. For each of the following sets, identify the cardinality of the set.

  a. {1,3,5,7,2,4,6,7,8,10}

  9


  b. x ∈ N | 0 ≤ x ≤ 64

  65


  c. x ∈ Z | -10 < x < 10 and x is even

  9


  d. x ∈ Z+ | x ≤ 6

  6


  e. the set of primary colors

  3


  f. the set of months in the year

  12


  g. the set of midterms in this class

  2


3. List the members of these sets

  a. (x | x is a real number such that x^2 = 1)

  {-1, 1}


  b. (x | x is a positive integer less than 7)

  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}


  c. (x | x is a squared integer and x < 99)

  {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81}


  d. (x | x is an integer such that x^2 = 3)

  {}


4. For the following sets: A = {4, 6, 8, 10}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11};

  a. What is the cardinality of A and B?

  9


  b. What is the union of A and B?

  {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}  


  c. What is the intersection of A and B?

  {4, 6}


  d. What is the complement of A, if the universal set is N?

  All elements of N except for 4, 6, 8, and 10: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, ...}


  e. What is A minus B?

  {8, 10}


  f. What is B minus A?

  {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}


  g. Does A minus B = B minus A?

  No


  h. The TA will draw a Venn diagram that shows why.



### Problems Involving Functions

For each of the functions shown below, decide whether it is one-to-one (injective), then note whether it is (strictly) increasing, (strictly) decreasing, or neither.


  1. f(x) = Math.sqrt(x), where x and f(x) are defined as doubles and x ≥ 0. 

  It is one-to-one, and is strictly increasing.


  2. f(x) = Math.floor(x), where x is defined as a double and f(x) as an integer. 

  f(x) = Math.floor(x) is not one-to-one, and it is increasing.


  3. f(x) = x + 5, where x and f(x) are integers. 

  It is a one-to-one function, and is strictly increasing.


  4. f(x) = x^3, where x is an integer. 

  It is one-to-one, and it is strictly increasing.


  5. f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8, where x is an integer. 

  It is not one-to-one, and is neither increasing nor decreasing.


  6. f(x) = x % 16, where x is a positive integer. 

  It is not one-to-one, and is neither increasing nor decreasing.


  7. f(x) = x.length(), where x is a Java string with 4-8 characters, and f(x) is an integer. 

  It is not one-to-one, and is neither increasing nor decreasing.


  8. f(x) = x.substring(1, 6), where x is a Java string with exactly 8 characters. 

  It is not one-to-one, and is neither increasing nor decreasing.
